				<h2>Gujarat</h2>
				<img src="gujarat.jpg" width="250" height="200">
				<p>
					Located on the country's western coast, Gujarat is one of the most vibrant coastal states of India, rich in crafts, history and natural beauty. The place derives its name from 'Gujaratta' meaning the land of Gurjars who passed through Punjab and settled in some parts of Western India. They were the sub tribes of the Huns who ruled the area during 8th and 9th centuries AD. The history of Gujarat dates back to 2000 BC. It is believed that Lord Krishna evacuated Mathura and settled his new capital on the west coast of Surashatra at Dwarka. Gujarat is bounded by the Arabian Sea on the west, Pakistan and Rajasthan in the north and northeast respectively, Madhya Pradesh in the southeast and Maharashtra in south. Gujarat with the longest coastline (1290km) in the country is renowned for its ancient temples, virgin beaches, and historic capitals replete with immense architectural assets, wildlife sanctuaries and hill resorts. Besides its varied destinations, this industrially advanced state is also known for its fascinating handicrafts, textiles, mouthwatering cuisine, lively fairs, festivals, and the colourful lifestyle.

				<h2>Kashmir</h2>
				<img src="kashmir.jpg" width="250" height="200">
				<p>
					Before considering one of the Kashmir packages, you need to know in detail about the seasons of Kashmir and which more favourable for travel. Otherwise a year-round destination, it would be ideal to travel to Kashmir in the summer to fall months between March and October. You can see its blossoming gardens, hear the bird song, take in sweeping views of the alpine meadows and simply watch Srinagar’s Dal Lake hustle back to life. Visit Pahalgam between April and November for some rafting and horse-riding. For golf, come between April and November. But if snow is your thing and you care for some snowboarding and skiing, head to Gulmarg between December and first half of March.
